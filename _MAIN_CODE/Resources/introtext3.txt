narrator "You make your way over to the direction she pointed towards, only tripping over your feet once as you try to grapple with the information dump the woman just laid on you. Dead? You? This didn't seem much like heaven... or hell, for that matter."

narrator "It just looked a lot like your average old morgue, actually. You try to recall what could have possibly happened to cause you to end up here, but it's as if you were just born today. Not a single memory can come to mind, everything slipping through your metaphorical mental fingers."

narrator "You take the set of clothes off the counter, and gingerly get dressed, making sure to grab the journal and clipboard left next to them while you do so."

narrator "After taking a deep breath - or atleast what you seem to remember breathing feeling like - you steel your nerves and take a look into the mirror."
